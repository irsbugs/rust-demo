    "Rust, like many programming languages, has the concept of \"keywords\". These identifiers mean something to the language, and so you cannot use them in places like variable names, function names, and other places. Raw identifiers let you use keywords where they would not normally be allowed. This is particularly useful when Rust introduces new keywords, and a library using an older edition of Rust has a variable or function with the same name as a keyword introduced in a newer edition.\n",
